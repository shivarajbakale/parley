# The design-system contract: Mantine owns colour, border, radius, elevation and
# layout, and no screen hand-rolls a primitive Mantine already ships. This app
# emits no utility classes, so a utility class in src/ styles nothing.
# See scripts/ui-lint.mjs.
ui-lint:
	$(NPM) run ui-lint

# The planning contract: a feature plan is a checked artifact, not a note. Every
# *.feature-plan.json validates, FEATURE-PLAN.md matches a fresh render of its
# source (it is generated — never hand-edit it), and a planned feature is
# registered in feature_list.json. See scripts/plan-lint.mjs.
plan-lint:
	$(NPM) run plan-lint

# The knowledge contract: the Mantine capability map every skill routes through
# still describes the installed packages, this repo's files, every component the
# source imports, and every component @mantine/core ships — one that is neither
# routed nor refused fails the build. See scripts/capability-lint.mjs.
capability-lint:
	$(NPM) run capability-lint

# The source contract: the capability map cites Mantine's own documentation and
# says when it was last read. `--online` additionally fetches every link.
doc-links:
	$(NPM) run doc-links

# The story contract: every shell composite carries a taxonomy title, at least
# three named stories, an explicit layout parameter, and argTypes wherever it
# takes args. See scripts/storybook-lint.mjs.
storybook-lint:
	$(NPM) run storybook-lint

# The accessibility gate documented in docs/principles/wcag-2.2-aa.md. Mounts
# each page under a memory router and asserts zero axe violations. The suite
# also runs inside `make test`; this target is the focused re-run the principle
# doc and the ux-prepass skill point at.
