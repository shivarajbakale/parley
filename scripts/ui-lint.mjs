/**
 * ui-lint — the design-system contract, enforced statically.
 *
 * Two contracts live here, and they fail for different reasons.
 *
 * 1. **Do not hand-roll a primitive.** A styled `<span>` instead of `Badge`, a
 *    raw `<button>` instead of `Button`. Those copies look right on the day
 *    they are written and drift the first time the system changes — a new
 *    radius, a new focus ring reaches the component and not the copy.
 *
 * 2. **Mantine owns everything a screen looks like** — colour, border, radius,
 *    elevation and layout. This app ships one styling system, so a utility
 *    class in `src/` is a class nothing emits: it reads as styling and does
 *    nothing. That is the `boundary` rule. It routed through a migration debt
 *    list while Tailwind was still here; `mantine-014` emptied and deleted the
 *    list, and `readDebt` is what would notice its return.
 *
 * Run it with `npm run ui-lint` (part of `make check`).
 *
 * Every rule is a single regex tested against one line at a time, with comments
 * stripped first. Nothing under `src/` is exempt any more: the kit that used to
 * be — the one directory allowed to contain a raw element — was deleted by
 * `mantine-008`, and Mantine's own components are not this repo's source.
 *
 * Adding a component? Add the rule that stops the next person hand-rolling it.
