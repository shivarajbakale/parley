# UX Patterns

Every screen follows the same rules. Deviating requires a DECISIONS.md entry.

## The four states (non-negotiable)

Every async surface renders all four states. Missing any one is a bug:

1. **Loading** — skeleton or spinner; never a blank region.
2. **Empty** — explain what will appear here and give one action to create it.
3. **Error** — human-readable message + retry action; never raw error text.
4. **Success** — the data, or explicit confirmation when there is nothing to show.

## List-page anatomy

- Page title + primary action top-right ("New thing").
- Filter/search above the list; sort on the column, not a separate control.
- Rows: identity first, metadata second, row actions last (icon buttons with labels).
- Pagination or infinite scroll — never an unbounded render.

## Form layout

- One column; label above field; helper text below; error text replaces helper text.
- Validate on submit first, on blur after first submit.
- Primary button bottom-right, disabled while submitting; never a double-submit.
- Cancel is a ghost/link button, never a second filled button.

## Modal vs inline confirm

- Destructive or irreversible -> modal confirm naming the object ("Delete 'Acme'?").
- Trivial/reversible (archive, toggle) -> inline optimistic update + undo toast.
- Never a modal for pure information display.

## Empty-state copy rules

- Say what belongs here, why it's empty, and what to do next — three short lines max.
- Always end with exactly one call-to-action button.
- No illustrations required; no lorem text ever.
