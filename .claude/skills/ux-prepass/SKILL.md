description: The mandatory UI/UX pre-pass checklist every UI-touching skill runs before declaring its task done. Single source of truth — the shared items and this platform's items live here, every UI skill links here, and evaluator-rubric.md's "UI pre-pass" row references this same wording.

# ux-prepass — the UI pre-pass checklist

This is the **single source of truth** for the items every UI-touching task must
pass before it's done. The wording here is the wording referenced from:

- `evaluator-rubric.md` (Visual Quality → "UI pre-pass" row).
- The `verify` skill (the closing sanity checks).
- The `add-feature`, `add-page`, `add-form`, `add-table`, `add-chart`, `add-settings`, `add-ui-component`, and `auth-page` skills (their Verify sections).

Do not inline the checklist into another file — that is what this skill exists
to prevent.

> This checklist catches *how* a screen is built. The decisions that come before
> it — which shape the screen takes, which controls it uses, how much it shows
> at once — are argued in:
>
> - [`docs/principles/density-and-disclosure.md`](../../../docs/principles/density-and-disclosure.md)
> - [`docs/principles/component-selection.md`](../../../docs/principles/component-selection.md)
> - [`docs/principles/spacing-and-type.md`](../../../docs/principles/spacing-and-type.md)

## Shared items (every platform)

- [ ] **Four states handled:** loading, empty, error, success. Every async
  surface renders all four. Missing any one is a bug.
- [ ] **Tap targets ≥ 44×44** on every interactive element.
- [ ] **Visible focus states** on every interactive element (`:focus-visible`
  ring, not a colour change alone).
- [ ] **Keyboard navigable** — tab order is logical, Enter / Esc behave as
  expected, and the surface is fully usable without a pointer.
- [ ] **Density and disclosure** — the page fits its job without a long scroll:
  at most 2.5 viewports tall on a 1040px-tall desktop, the primary action inside
  the first viewport, at most one banner at a time, success shown as a toast,
  confirmation as a modal, and secondary content in a sidebar, a tab or a
  collapsed section rather than one more card down the page.

## Electron + Mantine items

- [ ] **Dark mode checked** — theme values only (Mantine props such as
  `c="dimmed"`, or `var(--mantine-color-*)`), and no raw hex / rgb / hsl /
  oklch in the diff.
- [ ] **Text overflow handled** — long strings truncate or wrap without
  breaking the layout (`<Text truncate>` on the string and
  `style={{ minWidth: 0 }}` on its flex parent, or a sensible `maw`), not a
  hidden overflow that clips the wrong thing.
- [ ] **Composed, not hand-rolled** — every primitive comes from
  `@mantine/core`, and every product-level piece from `src/components/`. No
  hand-built surface where `Card` or `Paper withBorder` exists, no
  `<button aria-pressed>` pills where `Tabs` / `SegmentedControl` /
  `Radio.Group` exist, no raw `<button>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`,
  `<select>`, or `<table>`. Read
  [`mantine-capabilities.md`](../use-mantine/mantine-capabilities.md)
  before composing, and prove it with `npm run ui-lint` — a green run is
  the evidence for this box.

## Where the boxes get checked

`npm run ui-lint` is the evidence for the composed box, `make a11y` for focus and keyboard, and `npm run ui-probe` measures overflow and layout in real chromium. The rest are yours to confirm by driving the window — see the `verify` skill.

## How skills reference this

In a skill's Verify section, replace any inline pre-pass block with:

```md
See `ux-prepass` for the mandatory UI gates. Confirm every box
before marking this task done.
```

The `<!-- ux-prepass:v4 -->` marker at the top of this file is the version — bump
it and update every reference if the items ever change in a breaking way.

## Why it's a skill, not a doc

A skill is an actionable unit an agent can read by name, and it appears in the
same Skills table every agent already reads at session start. A checklist in
`docs/` gets found only by someone already looking for it.
