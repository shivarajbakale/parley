 * The UI probe runs in real chromium, not jsdom.
 *
 * jsdom has no layout engine: every getBoundingClientRect is a zero rect, so
 * every measurement this probe exists to take would come back 0. Browser mode
 * gives real computed styles and real box geometry with no dev server to boot.
 *
 * Kept out of `vite.config.ts` on purpose — `npm test` stays a fast jsdom run,
 * and the pure rule unit tests under scripts/ui-probe/__tests__ run there.
